This Python script allows users to "code" or "decode" a message using simple string manipulations. The message is entered by the user, split into individual words, and processed based on the user's choice.

### Explanation:
1. **Input:**
   - The user provides a message and chooses whether to "code" or "decode" the message by entering `1` (for coding) or `2` (for decoding).

2. **Coding (if coding = 1):**
   - For words with 3 or more characters, the first character is moved to the end of the word, and two predefined strings (`"fef"` and `"asd"`) are appended to the beginning and end, respectively.
   - For words shorter than 3 characters, the word is reversed.
   
3. **Decoding (if coding = 2):**
   - For words with 3 or more characters, the extra characters (`"fef"` and `"asd"`) are removed, and the last character is moved back to the front.
   - For shorter words, the original reversal is undone by reversing the word again.

4. **Example Coding Output:**
   ```
   Enter the Message: 
   hello world
   Enter the 1 for coding and 2 for decoding: 1
   hello world
   efellohasd owrldwasd
   ```

5. **Example Decoding Output:**
   ```
   Enter the Message: 
   efellohasd owrldwasd
   Enter the 1 for coding and 2 for decoding: 2
   hello world
   ```

This script provides a simple and customizable way to encode and decode text with basic string manipulation.
